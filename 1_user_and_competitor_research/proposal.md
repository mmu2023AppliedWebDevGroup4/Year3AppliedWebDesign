# Proposal 

The proposal is to create a guide to the Manchester fashion scene for students attending Manchester Metropolitan University. It offers them a one stop shop of what is considered on trend in accordance with the Manchester fashion scene. It will ease the nerves of any new students who are not from the area but are wishing to make a great first impression, whilst still catering to current students attending the University who wish to be ahead of the trends and privy to exclusive drops and discounts.


The website will cater to a niche market and show them the latest street wear trends in Manchester. Furthermore, the website will include a detailed homepage walking through the sites aim, three fashion pages split out by gender (Women, Men, and gender-neutral fashion), a discount page, a limited edition drops page, a news and latest trends page, a FAQ page, an event in Manchester page, a feedback page, a spotted page for outfit inspiration, and a map of Manchester’s coolest fashion haunts. By including this information, the website becomes a one stop shop for every Manchester Metropolitan student who wishes to understand and dress in accordance with the Manchester environment. 


The website will focus specifically on Manchester based brands and offer a clear guide of where to shop, any deals currently on, exclusive codes to use, limited edition drops and a view on the influences on Manchester fashion.
The website will be branded as minimalist with yellow being the accent colour. It will use classic Manchester phrases and the logo will include a bee, the symbol of Manchester. By theming it to subtly include Manchester influences it will make it clear that this website is made by Manchester students for Manchester students.

## Communication strategy


Primary Message: To provide a one stop shop on the Manchester Fashion scene. It will answer the questions of what is on trend? Where should I shop? Are their discounts I could use? Whilst promoting local businesses and encouraging footfall in the Manchester City Centre.


We want to communicate that this is a safe space for any new or returning students who want to make a great impression. It caters to people’s desire to be socially up to date and feel comfortable in their environment. It breaks initial barriers and tackles new students’ nervousness to attend a city that is so rich in culture. This is what puts our website apart from others. It offers a specific guide to students and caters to their feelings of nervousness and being shy on their first day in a new city. This will set us apart from other websites, which do not offer that personal touch.


The site will convey this message by being user friendly, simple branding that caters to people of a student age. It will have relevant pop culture references and the language used will make students feel like they are talking to a friend about fashion rather than using a website. This unique approach will stand this website apart from its competitors and propel it into mainstream us amongst students attending Manchester Met Uni
